## What is image classification?

Imagine the classical example: You are given a set of images each of which either depicts a cat or a dog. Instead of labeling the pictures all on your own, you want to use an algorithm to do the work for you: It "looks" at the whole picture and outputs probabilities for each of the classes it was trained on.

This is usually made possible through training neural networks, which we describe in more detail in other articles. (Note: There are other techniques but they do not play a role in practice due to performance.) As in other applications of supervised learning, the network is fed with a sufficient training data â€“ namely labeled images of cats and dogs.

What happens in between the image and output is somewhat obscure and we are going into greater detail in other posts. But in simple terms, most networks break down the image into abstract shapes and colors, which are used to form a hypothesis regarding the image's content.
